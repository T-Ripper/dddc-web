            Prophet John Jelili Yekiniâ€™s call was a similitude of Bibilical
            context. He was endorsed heavily with the gift of dream
            interpretation like Joseph Gen
            <br /> He was gifted with sharp and accurate vision like Prophet
            Isaiah, Elijah, Elisha and a host of others.
            <br />
            The church is fully endowed with series of prophetic application as
            led by the Spirit of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ in John 9:6 spat on
            the ground and made clay of the spittle and he anointed the eyes of
            the blind man with the clay. In Mark 8:23, it was recorded that he
            took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town and when
            he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him, he asked him if
            he saw ought.
